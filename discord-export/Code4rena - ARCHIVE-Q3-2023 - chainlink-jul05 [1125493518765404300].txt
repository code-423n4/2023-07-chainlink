**Wardens please note:** We are aware that there are a couple of diagrams that are currently not rendering on the website. We are working on this fix. In the meantime, please feel free to review them directly on the repo. Thanks!

Reposting a question and answer here for everyone:
Question: In the documentation, it says "Proposers can also cancel so that they may "undo" proposals with mistakes in them." but I couldn't find any functionality that allows proposers to cancel their proposal.
Answer: this refers to the configuration diagram here https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-chainlink#callproxy-manychainmultisig-rbactimelock The ManyChainMultiSig for proposers also has the CANCELLER role on the RBACTimelock

There is typo in tests, renaming like this helped me
import {ManyChainMultiSigBaseSetRootAndExecuteTest} from "./manyChainMultiSigBaseTest.t.sol"; ---->
import {ManyChainMultiSigBaseSetRootAndExecuteTest} from "./ManyChainMultiSigBaseTest.t.sol";

@🐺wardens, to aid the sponsor team in making the best use of their time, when you have a question, please create a group DM to include @Alex Coventry, @kaleofduty | Chainlink Labs and @Yos | Chainlink. Whomever is available will then be able to respond and allow the others to be available for your fellow wardens.

Also, questions for the team should be reserved to protocol inquiries and not basic set up questions.  If there are any concerns, please let us know in the #❓questions channel. Thank you for your help!
